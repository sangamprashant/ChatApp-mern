## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local development environment.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

3. Customize the chat interface as needed by modifying the HTML and CSS code. You can add your own styles, messages, and functionality to create a fully functional chat application.

4. Make sure to include the necessary JavaScript logic for handling user interactions and real-time communication. The `code.js` file is provided for this purpose.

5. If you intend to use Socket.io for real-time communication, make sure you have a server-side component set up to handle Socket.io connections. Include the Socket.io script reference in your HTML file as shown in the template.

6. Test your chat application locally or deploy it to a web server to make it accessible to users.

## Structure

The HTML template is structured as follows:

- The `<head>` section includes metadata, the title of the web page, and a link to an external stylesheet (`style.css`).

- The `<body>` section contains the main content of the chat application.

  - The chat interface is divided into two screens: the "Join Chatroom" screen and the "Chat Screen."

  - The "Join Chatroom" screen allows users to enter their username and join the chat.

  - The "Chat Screen" displays the chat messages, user interface elements for sending messages, and an option to exit the chat.

  - Sample HTML elements for chat messages and updates are provided but commented out. You can use these as a reference for displaying real messages.

- JavaScript files (`socket.io.js` and `code.js`) are included at the bottom of the `<body>` to provide the necessary functionality for real-time communication and user interactions.

## Dependencies

- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/): This template includes a script reference to Socket.io from the [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/) CDN. Socket.io is used for real-time communication in the chat application.
